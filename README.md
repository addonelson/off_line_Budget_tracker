# off_line_Budget_tracker

## Description 

This application can run both on line and offline to support a user on the go. I can't tell you how many times I have been in a store or out and about and didnt have service so I couldnt accomplish what i needed to in an application or online. This application is designed to remove that headache.This PWA (progressive web app) is able to work offline because of its service worker script, web app manifest and cache API.
